# Foto Finder: Mod 1

For this project we were asked to recreate the comp of the Turing Foto-Finder. Foto-Finder is a way for users to save images with a title and caption as image cards. They can favorite images they love and delete image cards they no longer want. Different albums can be created for different groupd of images. All cards are saved in local storage.

## Motivation

As a final mod project, Foto Finder revisited previously developed HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript skills. It tested each individual to see if we could reuse the skills we previously developed and further tested my ability to design a UI that perfectly matched the comp and was interactive with the user. The best part of creating this project was learning proving to myself that I could implement what I had learned as a team, on an individual project.
